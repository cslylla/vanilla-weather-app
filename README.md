# Vanilla Weather App

## Project Description

*I created this project as a final work of the **SheCodes** Plus workshop. This project is a **weather forecast web application** which can be accessed through any web browser to see current weather and a six-day forecast. It provides location, time, temperatures and weather conditions.*

---

### 1. Key features

- The **single-site** web app is built with **Vanilla JavaScript**, HTML and CSS; and it uses a free weather **API**
- The layout of the page uses **bootstrap**
- The UI design was created with **accessibility** in mind
- Current temperature can be displayed in **Celsius or Fahrenheit**

### 2. Usage

- You can **access** the application in any browser with an internet connection; no need to install anything
- You can either:
  - **Enter a location** into the search bar to look up data for the city and then click on search
  - Click on the *My location* button and **enable the location** services in the popup of the browser to see data for your current location
- The following data will be shown for the given location:
  - name of the city
  - current temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit
  - current weather conditions with animated icon
  - current day and time
  - "feels like" temperature, wind, humidity, sunset and sunrise times for the current day
  - six-day forecast minimum and maximum temperatures with weather conditions
